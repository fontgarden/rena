# Rena Typeface

Rena is a neo-grotesk typeface designed in 2024 by Eli Heuer and published by Font Garden.

The design takes some inspiration from the typefaces Replica and Helvetica. Instead of using Replica's 10 unit grid, Rena uses a 4-unit grid that allows for more optical corections and more closly reseblms the form of Helvetica.
